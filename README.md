This is a bukkit version (one of the first) of goldenfriends, I leave it here so you can see more or less how it is made (and as a portfolio so you can see how I program more or less).

I remind you that the original one that is for sale is made in Bungeecord, with a Mysql storage system and connection to other proxies with redis.
