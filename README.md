This is a bukkit version (one of the first) of the goldenfriends, I leave it so you can see more or less how it is done (and as a portfolio to see how I code more or less).

I remind you that the original that is for sale is made in Bungeecord, with a Mysql storage system and connection to other proxies with redis.
